Sync local and cloud db notes

* on the client side we'll run a service worker in the background
* the service worker will run on startup and perhaps every hour or so while app is running
* sync button on the UI somewhere so user can initiate a db sync

*** if the app is running and online ***
* after user make a change to the db, a sync will get initiated for that entity
* when a change is made for to entity, the DbUpdates entity gets updated as well
* There should only ever be one record in the DbUpdates table
* The timestamp should be updated after every single db change
* Also the timestamp for the table should be updated
* The local db will also have this DbUpdates table
* The service worker will implement logic to check if timestamps match.
* For example, if the UpdatedDateTime stamp on the Cloud db is greater than its
local counterpart, then the db needs updating
* If the main timestamp is greater, then check each table's timestamp.
* For example, if the OrphansUpdateTimeStamp is greater than its local counterpart,
then that table needs to be updated.
* The data should get updated in the background asyncronously


*** if the app is running and offline ***
* cache changes somehow. maybe additional tables???
* I don't want to sync cloud db with local db, I want to sync local with cloud.
* So I don't want to make direct changes to the local db if offline.
